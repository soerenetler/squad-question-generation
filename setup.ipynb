The latter can also be reached following a road extending east from Golm past Sanssouci Park to the Jägervorstadt quarter of Potsdam. The railway between Wildpark and Nauen was opened in 1902 as part of the single-tracked bypass railway (Umgehungsbahn) intended to connect the radial railway lines originating from Berlin. A station was established in Golm. In the 1950s this line became part of the Berlin outer ring and was double-tracked. Golm is now a passenger station for regional trains to Potsdam, Wustermark, Hennigsdorf, and Berlin Schönefeld Airport. Golm has also bus connections to Potsdam and Neu Töplitz and is included in fare zone C (Tarifbereich C)[2] of Berlin's public transport system and in fare zone B of Potsdam's public transport system.\")\n",
